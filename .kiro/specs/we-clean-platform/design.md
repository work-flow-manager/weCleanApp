# Design Document: We-Clean.app

## Overview

We-Clean.app is a comprehensive SaaS platform for cleaning businesses that connects administrators, managers, cleaning teams, and customers through a unified system. The platform features role-specific dashboards, job scheduling and tracking, GPS location services, photo verification, invoicing, and analyticsâ€”all presented with a distinctive pink glassmorphism design aesthetic.

The application will be built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) using Next.js 14 with React Server Components, providing a responsive and app-like experience across devices while maintaining excellent performance and SEO benefits.

## Architecture

### System Architecture

We-Clean.app will follow a modern web application architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend Layer**
   - Next.js 14 with App Router for page routing and server components
   - React 18 for UI components and client-side interactivity
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline access and mobile installation

2. **Backend Services**
   - Next.js API routes for server-side logic
   - Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
   - Real-time subscription services for live updates

3. **External Integrations**

4. **job_team_members**
   - Composite primary key: job_id, user_id
   - Foreign keys: job_id, user_id

### Row-Level Security (RLS)

Supabase RLS policies will be implemented to ensure data security:

1. Users can only access data related to their business
2. Team members can only view their assigned jobs
3. Customers can only view their own jobs and invoices
4. Admins and managers have broader access within their business

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Flow

1. Users register or log in through Supabase Auth
2. JWT tokens are used for session management
3. Role-based access control determines available features

### Authorization Matrix

| Feature | Admin | Manager | Team | Customer |
|---------|-------|---------|------|----------|
| View All Jobs | âœ“ | âœ“ | - | - |
| Create Jobs | âœ“ | âœ“ | - | âœ“ |
| Assign Jobs | âœ“ | âœ“ | - | - |
| Update Job Status | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ | - |
| Upload Photos | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ | - |
| View Analytics | âœ“ | âœ“ | - | - |
| Manage Team | âœ“ | âœ“ | - | - |
| Customize Branding | âœ“ | - | - | - |
| Manage Services | âœ“ | âœ“ | - | - |
| Create Invoices | âœ“ | âœ“ | - | - |
| View Own Jobs | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ | âœ“ |
| Submit Reviews | - | - | - | âœ“ |
